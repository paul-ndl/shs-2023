    <h1>Roger Federer retiring from tennis after many ‘challenges’</h1>

    <p> First Serena, now Roger. Roger Federer, arguably the greatest men’s tennis player of all time, announced
        Thursday he will be retiring from the sport after the Laver Cup next week in London. The 41-year-old cited the
        challenges of age and injuries. The Swiss maestro has won 20 Grand Slam events in his illustrious career. Roger

        Wimbledon in 2021, losing in the fourth round to Hubert Hurkacz. He has battled a persistent knee injury since
        then, which has kept him off the court. “Of all the gifts that tennis has given me over the years, the greatest,
        without a doubt, has been the people I’ve met along the way: my friends, my competitors, and most of all the
        fans who give the sport its life. Today, I want to share some news with all of you,” Federer said in a
        statement. “As many of you know, the past three years have presented me with challenges in the form of injuries
        and surgeries. I’ve worked hard to return to full competitive form. But I also know my body’s capacities and
        limits, and its message to me lately has been clear. I am 41 years old, I have played more than 1,500 matches
        over 24 years. Tennis has treated me more generously than I ever would have dreamt, and now I must recognize
        when it’s time to end my competitive career. The Laver Cup next week in London will be my final ATP event. I
        will play more tennis in the future, of course, but just not in Grand Slams or on the tour.” Roger Federer and

        the most dominant player in the sport. Federer’s first Grand Slam championship came at Wimbledon in 2003 — the
        first of five straight titles he won at the All England Club. In 2004, Federer won three of the four Grand
        Slams, with only the French Open escaping him. “This is a bittersweet decision, because I will miss everything
        that the tour has given me. But at the same time, there is so much to celebrate,” Federer said. “I consider
        myself one of the most fortunate people on Earth. I was given a special talent to play tennis, and I did it at a
        level that I never imagined, for much longer than I ever thought possible. “The last 24 years on tour have been
        an incredible adventure. While it sometimes felt like it went by in 24 hours, it has also been so deep and
        magical that it seems as if I’ve already lived a lifetime. I have had the immense fortune to play in front of
        you in over 40 different countries. I have laughed and cried, felt joy and pain, and most of all I have felt
        incredibly alive.” Federer finally completed his career Grand Slam at Roland Garros in 2009, with many of his
        attempts before and after thwarted by longtime rival Rafael Nadal. Federer, Nadal and later Novak Djokovic ruled
        the men’s sport for two decades with 63 Grand Slam titles between them. Roger Federer hits a drop shotAP Roger

        had won 20 Grand Slams before Nadal won the Australian and French Opens this year, while Djokovic claimed
        Wimbledon. The epic battles between the three on the biggest stages of the sport will never be forgotten. Serena
        Williams announced her retirement ahead of the U.S. Open earlier this month.</p>
