    <h1>Roger Federer’s last match is doubles loss with Rafael Nadal</h1>

    <p> Controversial NHL legend dead at 84 Tennis legend says security guard refused to allow him into Wimbledon Tennis
        rival had ‘very complicated’ feud with Roger Federer’s wife Rafael Nadal withdraws from Laver Cup: ‘I’m not
        good’ LONDON — This day, this match, had to come, of course, for Roger Federer, and for tennis, just as it
        inevitably must for every athlete in every sport. Federer bid adieu Friday night with one last contest before he
        heads into retirement at age 41 after a superlative career that spanned nearly a quarter-century and included 20
        Grand Slam titles and a statesman’s role. He wrapped up his days as a professional player with a loss in doubles
        alongside his longtime rival Rafael Nadal for Team Europe in the Laver Cup against Frances Tiafoe and Jack Sock
        of Team World. The truth is that the victors, the statistics and the score (OK, for the record it was 4-6, 7-6
        (2), 11-9) did not matter, and were all so entirely beside the point. The occasion was, after all, about the
        farewell itself. Or, better, the farewells, plural: Federer’s to tennis, to the fans, to his competitors and
        colleagues. And, naturally, each of those entities’ farewells to Federer. “It’s been a perfect journey,” Federer
        said. “I would do it all over again.” When the match and, with it, his time in professional tennis ended,
        Federer hugged Nadal, then Tiafoe and Sock. And then Federer began crying. There were plenty of tears to go
        around; Nadal wiped his own away, too. “When Roger leaves the tour, an important part of my life is leaving,
        too,” said Nadal, 36, who used the words “sad” and “unforgettable” to describe the occasion. Roger Federer hits

        cascades of clapping and yells of affection came from the stands, Federer put his hands on his hips, his chest
        heaving. Then he mouthed, “Thank you,” while applauding right back toward the spectators who had chanted, “Let’s
        go, Roger! Let’s go!” during the concluding moments of a match that lasted more than two hours and ended at
        about 12:30 a.m. His wife, Mirka, their four children — twin girls and twin boys — and Federer’s parents joined
        him on the court afterward for embraces and, yes, more bawling. Members of both teams joined together to hoist
        Federer up in the air. see also Roger Federer makes his tearful tennis goodbye “It’s been a wonderful day. I
        told the guys I’m happy; I’m not sad,” Federer said. “I enjoyed tying my shoes one more time. Everything was the
        last time.” The Swiss star announced last week that the three-day team event, which was founded by his
        management company, would be his final event before retirement, then made clear the doubles outing would be the
        last match. His surgically repaired right knee — the last of three operations came shortly after a loss in the
        Wimbledon quarterfinals in July 2021, which will go down as his official exit in singles — is in no shape to
        allow him to continue. “For me, just personally, (it was) sad in the first moment, when I came to the conclusion
        it’s the best decision,” Federer said in an interview with The Associated Press this week about his emotions
        when realizing it was time to go. “I kind of held it in at first, then fought it off. But I could feel the
        pain.” He had said he wanted this to feel more like a party than a funeral, and the crowd obliged, rising for a
        loud and lengthy standing ovation when Federer and Nadal — each wearing a white bandanna, blue shirt and white
        shorts — emerged together from a tunnel leading out to the black court for the last match on Day 1 at the O2
        Arena. They remained on their feet for nearly 10 minutes, through the pre-match warmup, holding aloft phone
        cameras to capture the moment. They came ready to roar for him, some with Swiss flags, some with homemade signs
        (“Idol Forever” read one), and they made themselves heard with a wall of sound when Federer delivered a forehand
        volley winner on the match’s second point. Similar reactions arrived merely at the chair umpire’s announcement
        before the third game of “Roger Federer to serve,” and again when he closed that game with a 117 mph service
        winner. “Obviously had 99.9% of the crowd against us. But it was super fun to just be a part of that match. I
        think we are going to be forever grateful to be a part of the GOAT’s final match,” Sock said, using the acronym
        for “Greatest of All-Time.” Doubles requires far less movement and court coverage, of course, so the stress on
        Federer’s knee was limited Friday. “Honestly,” he said, acknowledging that leading into the match there were the
        sorts of nerves he’d get before a Grand Slam final, “I was so surprised how well I was able to play tonight.”

        touches of his old flair, to be sure, and of rust, as to be expected. There were a couple of early forehands
        that sailed several feet too long. There also was a forehand that slid right between Sock and Tiafoe and seemed
        too good to be true — and, it turned out, was: The ball traveled through a gap below the net tape and so the
        point was taken away from Federer and Nadal. Although this match amounted to, essentially, a glorified
        exhibition, all four doubles participants played as if they wanted to win. That was clear when Sock, a
        three-time major champion in doubles who is 29, leaped and screamed after one particularly terrific volley or
        when Tiafoe, 24, sent a couple of shots right at Federer and Nadal. There were moments of levity. Federer and
        Nadal were able to laugh after a bit of confusion over which should go for a ball on a point they lost. After
        Nadal somehow flicked one back-to-the-net shot around the post, only for it to land barely wide, Tiafoe, a
        semifinalist at the U.S. Open, crossed over to extend a hand with congratulations for the effort. In the first
        set, the older duo couldn’t quite hear each other between points, so Federer trotted from the net back to the
        baseline to consult with Nadal, then pointed to his ear to signal what the issue was. Roger Federer tears up
        during his farewell ceremony.AP Before Federer began winning Grand Slam titles in 2003, the men’s mark for most
        major tennis championships was 14 by Pete Sampras. Federer blew past that, accumulating eight at Wimbledon, six
        at the Australian Open, five at the U.S. Open and one at the French Open, setting a new standard that Nadal, now
        with 22, and Novak Djokovic, with 21, equaled, then surpassed, as part of a golden era for the sport. Surely,
        there are those who would have found it particularly apt to see Federer finish across the net from Nadal, often
        an on-court nemesis but eventually an off-court friend. Maybe it could have taken place about 15 miles away at
        Centre Court of the All England Club, say, or in Court Philippe Chatrier at Roland Garros, or Rod Laver Arena at
        Melbourne Park, or even Arthur Ashe Stadium, the centerpiece of the U.S. Open, the lone Grand Slam tournament at
        which they never faced off, somehow. Perhaps they could have provided everyone with one final installment of a
        head-to-head matchup as memorable as any in the long history of their sport — or, indeed, any other. Roger vs.
        Rafa — just one name apiece required — belongs up there with McEnroe vs. Borg (as it happens, the two Laver Cup
        team captains, John and Bjorn), Evert vs. Navratilova, Sampras vs. Agassi, Ali vs. Frazier, Magic vs. Bird,
        Brady vs. Manning, and so on. Over the years, Federer and Nadal showed off individual greatness and compelling
        contrasts across their 40 matches, 14 at Grand Slam tournaments, nine in major finals: righty vs. lefty,
        attacker vs. grinder, seeming effortlessness vs. relentless intensity. And yet, there was an unmistakable
        element of poetry with these two men who challenged each other and elevated each other performing as partners,
        slapping palms and sharing smiles. This goodbye follows that of Serena Williams, the owner of 23 major singles
        championships, at the U.S. Open three weeks ago after a third-round loss. It leaves questions about the future
        of a game he and she dominated, and transcended, for decades. One key difference: Each time Williams took the
        court in New York, the looming question was how long her stay would endure — a “win or this is it” prospect.
        Friday WAS it for Federer, no matter the result. What do you think? Post a comment. “All the players will miss
        him,” said Casper Ruud, who beat Sock in singles 6-4, 5-7, 10-7. The day’s other results, which left Team Europe
        and Team World tied at 2-2: Stefanos Tsitsipas defeated Diego Schwartzman 6-2, 6-1 in a match interrupted
        briefly when an environmental protester lit a portion of the court and his own arm on fire, and Alex de Minaur
        got past Andy Murray 5-7, 6-3, 10-7. Due to begin playing shortly after the end of Murray’s loss, Federer and
        Nadal first provided him with some coaching tips, then watched part of that one on TV together in a room at the
        arena, waiting for their turn. When Federer and Nadal were in action, it was Djokovic’s turn to suggest
        strategy. The last hurrah came after a total of 103 career singles trophies and 1,251 wins in singles matches
        for Federer, both second only to Jimmy Connors in the Open era, which began in 1968. At the height of his
        powers, Federer appeared in a record 10 consecutive Grand Slam finals, winning eight, from 2005-07. Extend that
        to 2010, and he reached 18 of 19 major finals. More than those numbers, folks will remember the powerful
        forehand, the one-handed backhand, the flawless footwork, the spectacularly effective serve and eagerness to get
        to the net, the willingness to reinvent aspects of his game and — the part of which he’s proudest — the unusual
        longevity. Beyond the elegance and effectiveness while wielding a racket, Federer’s persona made him an
        ambassador for tennis, someone whose immense popularity helped attract fans. “This is not the end-end, you know.
        Life goes on. I’m healthy, I’m happy, everything’s great,” Federer said, “and this is just a moment in time.”
